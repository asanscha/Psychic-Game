# Psychic-Game

Letter guessing game with a the computer randomly selecting a letter.

The game should display the user's letter guesses until the user guesses the correct letter, or the user runs out of guesses (10 attempts).

Wins and losses will be recorded as the game progresses.

Mainly used if/else and basic functions to create the game.

I left in a commented-out array to show some learning. Someone showed me how to create that array using the split method.
